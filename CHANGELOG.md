## v0.5.0 (2014-12-15)
- Timer class `capnp.getTimer()`
- pycapnp is now thread-safe and allows an event loop to be run in each thread

- Inheritance now works correctly for interfaces (previously inherited methods were inaccessible from pycapnp)
- Add ability to import modules with dashes or spaces. Use underscores in place of them

- Add `num_first_segment_words` argument wherever message creation can occur
- Allow restoring a null objectId by passing None to restore
- Support ordered dictionary in `to_dict`
- Add ListSchema class and schemas for native types under `capnp.types` which completes all the Schemas needed to be wrapped. See `test_schema.py` for examples using it

- Remove onDrained since it was removed upstream
- Replace usage of strings as enum type with custom `_DynamicEnum` class.
- Also change `Struct.which()` method to be a property `Struct.which` and return an enum type (`_DynamicEnumField`, which behaves much like `_DynamicEnum`).
- TwoPartyServer.run_forever() now will handle more than 1 simulataneous connection.
- Change exception wrapper to detect and raise AttributeError for field lookup exceptions (Fixes problem in Python3.x `__dir__`)
- Allow setting of fields with python dicts.


## 0.4.1 (2013-12-18)
- Remove python 3.2 from travis tests. Python 3.2 still should work fine, but it's more trouble than it's worth to write unicode tests that work in both it and Python2.
- Fix problems with null characters in Text/Data fields. Fixes #19


## 0.4.0 (2013-12-12)
- Initial working version of RPC
- Add get_root_as_any to _MessageReader

- Add _short_str function for use in capnp_test_pycapnp.py
- Add test script for testing with https://github.com/kaos/capnp_test
- Add handling of DynamicObject
- Fix lists of lists or dicts for from_dict


## v0.3.14 (2013-09-04)
- Fix problem with to_dict


## v0.3.13 (2013-09-04)
- Add _DynamicStructBuilder.to_bytes() and <struct module>.from_bytes()
- Change == on StructSchema to return cbool
- Add Builder and Reader ABCs for each struct type

## v0.3.12 (2013-09-03)

- Change import hook to require modules to end in '_capnp'

## v0.3.11 (2013-09-01)
- Forgot to change project name in setup.py

## v0.3.10 (2013-09-01)
- Change all references to old project name (change from capnpc-python-cpp to pycapnp)
- Change DynamicValue.Reader lists to be returned as _DynamicListReader
- Unify setters for DynamicList and DynamicStruct
- Add shortcuts for reading from / writing to files.  In Python, it doesn't make much sense to force people to muck around with MessageReaders and MessageBuilders since everything is landing on the heap anyway.  Instead, let's make it easy:  MyType.read[Packed]From(file) reads a file and returns a MyType reader.  MyType.newMessage() returns a MyType builder representing the root of a new message.  You can call this builder's write[Packed]To(file) method to write it to a file.
- Store Builders by value rather than allocate them separately on the heap (matches treatment of Readers).  v0.3 fixes the bug that made this not work.
- Wrap MessageBuilder::setRoot().
- Add tests based on TestAllTypes from the C++ test.capnp.  Fix problems uncovered in capnp.pyx.
- Implement __str__ and __repr__ for struct and list builders.  __str__ uses prettyPrint while __repr__ shows the type name and the low-whitespace stringification.  Also implement __repr__ for StructSchema, just because why not?
